This code is a version of the SLEUTH CA urban growth and land use change model that uses a genetic algorithm to do the calibration.

Unzip and compile the new code for SLEUTH using the makefile. The scenario file can be the same. There is sample
data for demo city and the two data sets used in the articles in the Input folder. in the Scenario folder is sample
run commands for the three cases. Use a shell script, called doit in the example. The shell script can be invoked using

sh doit &

The job will run in the background, sending the output data to the file where it is directed in the script.

Note that doit has a set of parameters and uses the "evolve" mode. If this set of parameters is included (i.e.
there are exactly eight, these values are used. Otherwise the default values are set and used as described in the paper.

It is recommended that the first 10 or 12 genes are selected and used for a narrow brute force final run. This should at least equal
the best results form brute force, but it will use far less CPU time.

I have not changed the use of MPI, and make no guarantees for runs in parallel. Code was added by Matthew Clarke-Lauer. See:
